summary: Artica Proxy Loopback Services Remotely Accessible Unauthenticated in github.com/gvalkov/tailon
description: |-
    Services that are running and bound to the loopback interface on the Artica
    Proxy are accessible through the proxy service. In particular, the "tailon"
    service is running, running as the root user, is bound to the loopback
    interface, and is listening on TCP port 7050. Security issues associated with
    exposing this network service are documented at gvalkov's 'tailon' GitHub repo.
    Using the tailon service, the contents of any file on the Artica Proxy can be
    viewed.
