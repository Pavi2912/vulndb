summary: HTTP request body disclosure in github.com/go-resty/resty/v2
description: |-
    A race condition in go-resty can result in HTTP request body disclosure across
    requests. This condition can be triggered by calling sync.Pool.Put with the same
    *bytes.Buffer more than once, when request retries are enabled and a retry
    occurs. The call to sync.Pool.Get will then return a bytes.Buffer that hasn't
    had bytes.Buffer.Reset called on it. This dirty buffer will contain the HTTP
    request body from an unrelated request, and go-resty will append the current
    HTTP request body to it, sending two bodies in one request. The sync.Pool in
    question is defined at package level scope, so a completely unrelated server
    could receive the request body.
