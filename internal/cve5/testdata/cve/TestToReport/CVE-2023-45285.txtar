-- CVE-2023-45285 --
id: GO-ID-PENDING
modules:
    - module: cmd
      versions:
        - fixed: 1.20.12
        - introduced: 1.21.0-0
          fixed: 1.21.5
      packages:
        - package: cmd/go
summary: Command 'go get' may unexpectedly fallback to insecure git in cmd/go
description: |-
    Using go get to fetch a module with the ".git" suffix may unexpectedly fallback
    to the insecure "git://" protocol if the module is unavailable via the secure
    "https://" and "git+ssh://" protocols, even if GOINSECURE is not set for said
    module. This only affects users who are not using the module proxy and are
    fetching modules directly (i.e. GOPROXY=off).
