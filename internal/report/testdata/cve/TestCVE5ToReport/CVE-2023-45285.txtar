-- CVE-2023-45285 --
id: PLACEHOLDER-ID
modules:
    - module: std
      packages:
        - package: cmd/go
summary: Command 'go get' may unexpectedly fallback to insecure git in cmd/go
description: |
    Using go get to fetch a module with the ".git" suffix may unexpectedly fallback to the insecure "git://" protocol if the module is unavailable via the secure "https://" and "git+ssh://" protocols, even if GOINSECURE is not set for said module. This only affects users who are not using the module proxy and are fetching modules directly (i.e. GOPROXY=off).
