summary: Consensus failures in github.com/btcsuite/btcd
description: |-
    Incorrect implementation of the consensus rules outlined in BIP 68 and BIP 112
    making btcd susceptible to consensus failures. Specifically, it uses the
    transaction version as a signed integer when it is supposed to be treated as
    unsigned. There can be a chain split and loss of funds.
