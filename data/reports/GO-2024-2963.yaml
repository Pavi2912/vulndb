summary: Denial of service due to improper 100-continue handling in net/http
description: |-
    The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a
    request with an "Expect: 100-continue" header with a non-informational (200 or
    higher) status. This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid
    state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail.

    An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can
    exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending "Expect:
    100-continue" requests which elicit a non-informational response from the
    backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and
    causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.
