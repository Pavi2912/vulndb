summary: |-
    MongoDB Tools Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in
    github.com/mongodb/mongo-tools
description: |-
    Usage of specific command line parameter in MongoDB Tools which was originally
    intended to just skip hostname checks, may result in MongoDB skipping all
    certificate validation. This may result in accepting invalid certificates.

    NOTE: this module uses its own versioning scheme that is not fully
    compatible with standard Go module versioning, so the affected versions in this
    report may differ from the versions listed in other advisories.

    According to the advisory, the affected versions are as follows: MongoDB Inc.
    MongoDB Database Tools 3.6 versions later than 3.6.5; 3.6 versions prior to
    3.6.21; 4.0 versions prior to 4.0.21; 4.2 versions prior to 4.2.11; 100 versions
    prior to 100.2.0. MongoDB Inc. Mongomirror 0 versions later than 0.6.0.
