summary: CSRF token validation vulnerability in github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
description: |-
    A cross-site request forgery vulnerability can allow an attacker to obtain
    tokens and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This can lead to
    unauthorized actions being taken on the user's behalf, potentially compromising
    the security and integrity of the application.

    The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF
    tokens within the application. The CSRF token is validated against tokens in
    storage but was is not tied to the original requestor that generated it,
    allowing for token reuse.
