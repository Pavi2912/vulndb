summary: Spoofed source IP address in github.com/shift72/caddy-geo-ip
description: |-
    The caddy-geo-ip (aka GeoIP) middleware for Caddy 2 allows attackers to spoof
    their source IP address via an X-Forwarded-For header, which may bypass a
    protection mechanism (trusted_proxy directive in reverse_proxy or IP address
    range restrictions).
