description: |
    Systems that rely on digest equivalence for image attestations may be
    vulnerable to type confusion.

    A maliciously crafted OCI Container Image can cause registry clients to
    parse the same image in two different ways without modifying the image's
    digest, invalidating the common pattern of relying on container image
    digests for equivalence.

    This problem has been addressed in newer versions by improving validation
    in manifest unmarshaling.
