summary: Chain halt panic in github.com/cometbft/cometbft
description: |-
    A vulnerability in CometBFTâ€™s validation logic for VoteExtensionsEnableHeight
    can result in a chain halt when triggered through a governance parameter change
    proposal on an ABCI2 Application Chain. If a parameter change proposal including
    a VoteExtensionsEnableHeight modification is passed, nodes running the affected
    versions may panic, halting the network.
