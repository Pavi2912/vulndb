summary: |-
    Cross-site scripting via missing binding syntax validation in
    github.com/crewjam/saml
description: |-
    The package does not validate the ACS Location URI according to the SAML binding
    being parsed. If abused, this flaw allows attackers to register malicious
    Service Providers at the IdP and inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint
    definition, achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in the IdP context during the
    redirection at the end of a SAML SSO Flow. Consequently, an attacker may perform
    any authenticated action as the victim once the victim's browser loads the SAML
    IdP initiated SSO link for the malicious service provider.

notes:
    - The fix introduced functions Endpoint.UnmarshalXML and IndexedEndpoint.UnmarshalXML, but we currently do not have a way to mark uses of xml.Unmarshal on a certain type as vulnerable.
