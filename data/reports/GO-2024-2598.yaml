summary: |-
    Verify panics on certificates with an unknown public key algorithm in
    crypto/x509
description: |-
    Verifying a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown
    public key algorithm will cause Certificate.Verify to panic.

    This affects all crypto/tls clients, and servers that set Config.ClientAuth to
    VerifyClientCertIfGiven or RequireAndVerifyClientCert. The default behavior is
    for TLS servers to not verify client certificates.
