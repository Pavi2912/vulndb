summary: |-
    Insecure CORS Configuration allowing wildcard origin with credentials in
    github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
description: |-
    The CORS middleware allows for insecure configurations that could potentially
    expose the application to multiple CORS-related vulnerabilities. Specifically,
    it allows setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to a wildcard ("*")
    while also having the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials set to true, which goes
    against recommended security best practices.
