summary: Credential leakage in github.com/aquasecurity/trivy
description: |-
    A malicious registry can cause Trivy to leak credentials for legitimate
    registries such as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Cloud
    Artifact/Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry (ACR) if the registry
    is scanned from directly using Trivy. These tokens can then be used to push/pull
    images from those registries to which the identity/user running Trivy has
    access. This vulnerability only applies when scanning container images directly
    from a registry. If you use Docker, containerd or other runtime to pull images
    locally and scan them with Trivy, you are not affected. To enforce this
    behavior, you can use the --image-src flag to select which sources you trust.
