summary: Login username enumeration in github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-UserService
description: |-
    The Casa OS Login page has a username enumeration vulnerability in the
    login page that was patched in Casa OS v0.4.7. The issue exists because
    the application response differs depending on whether the username or
    password is incorrect, allowing an attacker to enumerate usernames by
    observing the application response. For example, if the username is
    incorrect, the application returns "User does not exist" with return
    code "10006", while if the password is incorrect, it returns
    "User does not exist or password is invalid" with return code "10013".
    This allows an attacker to determine if a username exists without knowing
    the password.
