summary: CORS Filter bypass in github.com/zeromicro/go-zero
description: |-
    The CORS Filter feature in go-zero allows users to specify an array of domains
    allowed in the CORS policy. However, the isOriginAllowed function uses
    strings.HasSuffix to check the origin, which can lead to a bypass via a domain
    like "evil-victim.com". This vulnerability is capable of breaking CORS policy
    and thus allowing any page to make requests and retrieve data on behalf of other
    users.
