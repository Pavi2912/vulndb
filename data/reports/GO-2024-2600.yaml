summary: |-
    Incorrect forwarding of sensitive headers and cookies on HTTP redirect in
    net/http
description: |-
    When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain match or
    exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward sensitive
    headers such as "Authorization" or "Cookie". For example, a redirect from
    foo.com to www.foo.com will forward the Authorization header, but a redirect to
    bar.com will not.

    A maliciously crafted HTTP redirect could cause sensitive headers to be
    unexpectedly forwarded.
