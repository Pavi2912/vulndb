summary: Authentication token leak in github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/v2
description: |-
    Using cloudevents.WithRoundTripper to create a cloudevents.Client with an
    authenticated http.RoundTripper causes the go-sdk to leak credentials to
    arbitrary endpoints. When the transport is populated with an authenticated
    transport, http.DefaultClient is modified with the authenticated transport and
    will start to send Authorization tokens to any endpoint it is used to contact.
