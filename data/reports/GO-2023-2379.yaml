summary: Denial of service due to malicious parameters in github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx
description: |-
    The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2 require a JOSE Header
    Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2
    iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its purpose is to intentionally
    slow down the key derivation function, making password brute-force and
    dictionary attacks more resource-intensive. However, if an attacker sets the p2c
    parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause excessive computational
    consumption.
