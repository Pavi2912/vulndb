summary: Denial of service via chunk extensions in net/http
description: |-
    A malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading
    from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than
    are in the body.

    A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to
    automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler
    fails to read the entire body of a request.

    Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including
    additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked
    encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender
    can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte
    transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to
    encoded bytes grows too small.
