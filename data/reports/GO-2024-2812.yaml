summary: Some CORS middleware allow untrusted origins in github.com/jub0bs/fcors
description: |-
    Some CORS middleware (more specifically those created by specifying two or more
    origin patterns whose hosts share a proper suffix) incorrectly allow some
    untrusted origins, thereby opening the door to cross-origin attacks from the
    untrusted origins in question.

    For example, specifying origin patterns "https://foo.com" and "https://bar.com"
    (in that order) would yield a middleware that would incorrectly allow untrusted
    origin "https://barfoo.com".
