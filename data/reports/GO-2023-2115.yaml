summary: CSRF token reuse vulnerability in github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
description: |-
    A cross-site request forgery vulnerability in this package can allow an attacker
    to inject arbitrary values and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. The
    attacker may inject arbitrary values without any authentication, or perform
    various malicious actions on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially
    compromising the security and integrity of the application.

    The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF
    tokens within the application. For 'safe' methods, the token is extracted from
    the cookie and saved to storage without further validation or sanitization. In
    addition, the CSRF token is validated against tokens in storage but not
    associated with a session, nor by using a Double Submit Cookie Method, allowing
    for token reuse.

notes:
    - There is a closely related vulnerability (GO-2023-2116), and it is not clear which fix applies to which vulnerability, so I have marked both fixes as applying to both vulnerabilities.
