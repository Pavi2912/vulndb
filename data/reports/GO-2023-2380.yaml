summary: Private key recovery via invalid curve point in github.com/ecies/go/v2
description: |-
    An attacker may be able to recover private keys due to a bug in the ECDH
    function.

    The library does not check whether the provided public key is on the curve,
    which means that an attacker can create a public key that is not on the curve
    and use it to recover the private key.

    A workaround is to manually check that the public key is valid by calling the
    IsOnCurve function from the secp256k1 libraries.
