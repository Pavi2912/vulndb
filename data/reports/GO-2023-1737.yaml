summary: Improper handling of file names in Content-Disposition HTTP header
description: |
    The filename parameter of the Context.FileAttachment function is
    not properly sanitized. A maliciously crafted filename can cause
    the Content-Disposition header to be sent with an unexpected
    filename value or otherwise modify the Content-Disposition header.
    For example, a filename of "setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt" will be sent
    as a file named "setup.bat".

    If the FileAttachment function is called with names provided by an
    untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause a file to
    be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously crafted
    attachment file name can modify the Content-Disposition header.
