summary: Container escape at build time in github.com/containers/buildah
description: |-
    A crafted container file can use a dummy image with a symbolic link to the host
    filesystem as a mount source and cause the mount operation to mount the host
    filesystem during a build-time RUN step. The commands inside the RUN step
    will then have read-write access to the host filesystem.

notes:
    - |
      GHSA-874v-pj72-92f3 is a DEPENDENT_VULNERABILITY
      of this report, but the GHSA database considers it an
      alias of CVE-2024-1753. Adding the GHSA as "related"
      prevents our tooling from adding it to the aliases field.
