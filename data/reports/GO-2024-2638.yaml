summary: |-
    ValidateVoteExtensions function in Cosmos SDK may allow incorrect voting
    power assumptions in github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
description: |-
    The default ValidateVoteExtensions helper function infers total voting power
    based on the injected VoteExtension, which are injected by the proposer.

    If your chain utilizes the ValidateVoteExtensions helper in ProcessProposal, a
    dishonest proposer can potentially mutate voting power of each validator it
    includes in the injected VoteExtension, which could have potentially unexpected
    or negative consequences on modified state. Additional validation on injected
    VoteExtension data was added to confirm voting power against the state machine.
