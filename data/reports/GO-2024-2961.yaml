summary: Limited directory traversal vulnerability on Windows in golang.org/x/crypto
description: |-
    httpTokenCacheKey uses path.Base to extract the expected HTTP-01 token value to
    lookup in the DirCache implementation. On Windows, path.Base acts differently to
    filepath.Base, since Windows uses a different path separator (\ vs. /), allowing
    a user to provide a relative path, i.e. .well-known/acme-challenge/..\..\asd
    becomes ..\..\asd. The extracted path is then suffixed with +http-01, joined
    with the cache directory, and opened.

    Since the controlled path is suffixed with +http-01 before opening, the impact
    of this is significantly limited, since it only allows reading arbitrary files
    on the system if and only if they have this suffix.
