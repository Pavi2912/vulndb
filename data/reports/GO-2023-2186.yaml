summary: Incorrect detection of reserved device names on Windows in path/filepath
description: |-
    On Windows, The IsLocal function does not correctly detect reserved device
    names in some cases.

    Reserved names followed by spaces, such as "COM1 ", and
    reserved names "COM" and "LPT" followed by superscript 1, 2, or 3, are
    incorrectly reported as local.

    With fix, IsLocal now correctly reports these names as non-local.
