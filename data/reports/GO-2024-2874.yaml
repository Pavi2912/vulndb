summary: |-
    Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol "Huckleberry" vulnerability in
    github.com/cosmos/ibc-go
description: |-
    The ibc-go module is affected by the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)
    protocol "Huckleberry" vulnerability. The vulnerability allowed an attacker to
    send arbitrary transactions onto target chains and trigger arbitrary state
    transitions, including but not limited to, theft of funds. It was possible to
    exploit this vulnerability in specific situations involving relaying packets in
    which the source chain is also the final destination chain. Affected networks
    are those that allow for fee grant capabilities and use a native Relayer (e.g.,
    Osmosis and Juno).
