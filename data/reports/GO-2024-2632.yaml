summary: |-
    JWX vulnerable to a denial of service attack using compressed JWE message in
    github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx
description: |-
    An attacker with a trusted public key may cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
    condition by crafting a malicious JSON Web Encryption (JWE) token with an
    exceptionally high compression ratio. When this token is processed by the
    recipient, it results in significant memory allocation and processing time
    during decompression.
